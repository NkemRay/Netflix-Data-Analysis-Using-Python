# Netflix Data Analysis

## Introduction

Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award wining TV shows, movies, animation, documentaries and more on thousands of internets connected devices
These analysis is done to leverage my analytics skills using some python libraries and further  use  power bi to visualize the data to get more insight and make recommendations.

## Data pre-processing 
Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, Numpy and Matplotlip were used for the analysis. I use this tool for cleaning and statistical analysis.

### Here are some of the questions use for data cleaning and exploration

1; Importing some important libraries for this analysis

2; Importing the dataset

3; Checking the first 20 data from the dataframe

4; Checking for duplicates

5; Deleting the rows having NaN values

6; Checking for null values

7; Checking for unique values

8; Checking for outliers on the 'duration column'

9; What is the distribution of movies and TV shows in the dataset?

10; What are the most popular movies and TV shows in the dataset base on the ratings?

11; How has the number of movies and TV shows added to Netflix changed over time?

12; What are the top countries of origin for movies and TV shows on Netflix?

13; What is the most common rating for movies and TV shows on Netflix?

14; Find the correlation between the duration of a movie or TV show and its rating?

15; What are the top directors of movies and TV shows on Netflix?

# Data Visualization

The vizz was done using power BI 

1;  Avg.Duration by types

# Conclusion and Recommendation

1; From the chat, the most distributed type is the movie category because it has high percentage of titles. Reasons been that;

-	Netflix is a streaming platform that tend to meet the most needed type by its audience and as such, high percentage of the public like to stream movies than TV shows. This could be one of the reasons for uploading more of movies than TV shows
-	Also, Netflix could have more movie license than that of the TV shows because movies are mostly created by small companies and networks thereby making the license  accessibility easier compared to TV shows that requires larger network and companies.
- Movies are mostly prefered cause of it duration compared to TV shows.

2; countries with least number of titles uploaded by netflix could be encouraged by providing  incentives to film makers and producers to enable them provide more content for the platform.

3; Base on the gauge chart above, it appears that average duration of TV shows is higher compared to movies. This is because most TV shows are structured in episodic narratives, with each episode lasting for about 45minutes. In this case, a single season have 5 episodes. In contrast, movies typically have a single narrative that lasts for 90 to 180 minutes, with no breaks or episodes. Therefore, the difference in duration between movies and TV shows is largely due to their different storytelling formats.
